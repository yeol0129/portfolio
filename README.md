# Projects
## 1. [Heart diease prediction model](https://github.com/yeol0129/heartdisease/blob/main/pf.md)
 In this project, I predicted patients with heart disease using data(from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction?select=heart.csv)) from patients with heart disease.
 First, I visualized the data and checked the relationship between heart disease and other components. After that, I modeled it through various models. As a result, the Random forest and CatBoost model showed an accuracy of 86%.
## 2. [X-ray Images classification](https://github.com/yeol0129/xray_ResNet50_Pneumonia/blob/main/pf.md)
## 3. [Abnormal Behavior Classification](https://github.com/yeol0129/AbnormalBehavior-Classification/blob/master/pf/pf.md)
