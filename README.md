I am a Bachelor of Science in Electronic Engineering and would like to work in data science and machine learning.
I became interested in machine learning through machine learning classes, and I studied more as a personal project.

# Projects
## 1. [Heart diease prediction model](https://github.com/yeol0129/heartdisease/blob/main/pf.md)
 In this project, I predicted patients with heart disease using data(from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction?select=heart.csv)) from patients with heart disease.
 First, I visualized the data and checked the relationship between heart disease and other components. After that, I modeled it through various models. As a result, the Random forest and CatBoost model showed an accuracy of 86%.
## 2. [X-ray Images classification](https://github.com/yeol0129/xray_ResNet50_Pneumonia/blob/main/pf.md)
A model was created to classify pneumonia using X-ray image data and CSV data(from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset)) of pneumonia patients.
ResNet50 was used as the image classification model, and the accuracy of the model was 96%.
## 3. [Abnormal Behavior Classification](https://github.com/yeol0129/AbnormalBehavior-Classification/blob/master/pf/pf.md)
This is the most recent project I completed, and in this project, I created a model for classifying assault using assault video images.
The data was taken from [here](https://www.aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=realm&dataSetSn=174), and there's a lot of image data divided into frames of the video, and json files. I used the json file to show the bounding box and code on the image. I used the Resnet50V2 model and the EfficientB0 model. 
In conclusion, the Resnet50 model has an accuracy of 82%, and the EfficientB0 model has an accuracy of 95%. Also, I checked whether the model can be classified well using assault photos on the Internet.
